omega electroproduction analysis
================================

More in the spirit of reproducible research than reusability, this
project contains code used to extract differential cross-sections of
omega (783) electroproduction off the proton. Currently the repository
contains, without explanation, the code used to skim data files and
build ROOT trees of relevant events with certain cuts and corrections
applied, along with some scripts for interactive analysis using CINT.
In time, I'll add instructions and generalizations of some analysis
code for reuse.
